# iOS Calculator

This was my first (and thus far only) iOS project: a simple calculator. It has some bugs that I am aware of, but I am uploading my code here without correction, 9 years after I built it, as just another example of a past project.

Nearly all the app logic is in `Calculator/Classes/CalculatorViewController.m`.
